ARMAMIN
========
A minimalistic project that demonstrates the usage of
[armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net) and cmake.

Usage
======
The configure script finds the armadillo library, compiles the 
program and links it automatically: 
```bash
./build config # configures project using cmake
./build # compile and link
./build install # installs the project
```
The executable file will be in the bin folder.
